# VIRTUAL-DOOR-LOCK-


 Write a python program that simulates a door lock system such that:

•	Password is set and stored in a variable,
•	Commands to instruct the door are stored in variables.
•	When a user enters the wrong password an error message is displayed and prompted to enter the password again.
•	When a user enters “open” a “The door is now open” statement is displayed, when the “open” is entered more that once, a message is displayed saying, “the door is    already open” 
•	When a user enters “close” a “The door is now locked” statement is displayed, when the “open” is entered more that once, a message is displayed saying, “the door is already locked”
•	When a user enters “quit” the process is terminated and message is displayed.
•	When a wrong message is entered or invalid key pressed a “Invalid input” message is displayed. 
•	When the door is locked or open, it prints out the last date/time the door was opened, eg “Door Last open  at 2022-07-05 08:46:20.535395”
